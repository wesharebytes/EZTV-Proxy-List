# EZTV Proxy is Back – 100% Working New Mirror Sites 2020

The EZTV site is the best source where you can download TV torrents. If your ISP blocks eztv or for some reason cannot access it, just go to one of the [EZTV proxy sites](http://wesharebytes.com/eztv-proxy-list-unblocked-eztv-mirror-sites-2020/). You will get instant access through the EZTV mirror so that you can download all the multimedia content you need.

# EZTV Proxies

Perhaps the easiest way to access the site is through EZTV proxies. A proxy server is a server that acts as an intermediary for requests from clients looking for resources from other servers. When accessing EZTV through a proxy server, external observers only see that you are connected to the proxy server and do not see that the proxy server is transmitting EZTV data to you.
EZTV proxies are sometimes mistaken for EZTV mirrors. Mirror 1337x is just a clone of the source site with a different domain name and servers. The EZTV proxy server, on the other hand, is a separate site that makes it easy to connect to the original EZTV, as well as often to other websites.
In practice, it doesn’t matter if you connect to EZTV through a proxy server or use an EZTV mirror, as they both provide about the same degree of privacy.

# Is EZTV blocked in my country?
Many countries continue to try to restrict access to EZTV for many reasons. But sometimes the tracker becomes unavailable for a while. However, they always advertise on their site when internal problems arise. However, these internal issues have been successfully resolved by mirrored websites that allow you to access EZTV even if it has been blocked.

EZTV's mirror sites make it easy for users to view their favorite content. If you receive a Cloudflare 522 error notification every time you want to access EZTV, it means that there is a problem with the hosting.


# How to unblock EZTV

Torrent tracking sites are generally blocked in two ways:

**DNS blocking (easy to defeat):**
ISPs use DNS hijacking to forward your DNS requests to their servers (when you type a domain name in your browser's URL bar). You can easily bypass DNS blocking by forcing your own DNS servers on your device. Most ISPs use a more extensive domain and IP lock.

**Comprehensive blocking of domains and IP addresses:**
The websites are accessible through a specific domain name (such as best-bittorrent-vpn.com) and are hosted under a specific IP address. ISPs blacklist blocked websites and prevent you from accessing them by domain name or IP address. The best way to avoid these blocks is to use a virtual private network (VPN).

However, some ISPs also (or alternatively) block the BitTorrent protocol itself.


**3 free methods to unblock torrent websites:**

**Tor Browser or Web Proxy (free)** - This method is effective for unblocking torrent websites (assuming the proxy website is not blocked by your ISP). Disadvantages include: slow connections, frequent captchas, no download encryption.

**Manual DNS configuration (free)** - This is the least effective solution and only works for a small percentage of ISP blocks (lazy). It doesn't encrypt your browsing traffic or torrent traffic.


**Method 1: Use a web proxy**
There are a number of free HTTPS (encrypted) web proxies that will load a website for you. This sometimes helps avoid network blocks (as long as the proxy site is not blocked as well).

Unfortunately, many of these sites (like kproxy.com) block torrent sites themselves. Another problem is that a proxy site can still use your ISP's DNS servers (leaving you vulnerable to DNS-based blocking).

So the best option is to use a torrent unblocking proxy site:

There are several of these websites. Most are versatile and allow you to unblock a number of commonly blocked categories such as YouTube, social media, and torrent websites.


**Method 2: use the Tor browser**
Tor Browser Bundle is a free web browser that allows you to easily route your browser traffic through multiple encrypted proxies. This not only bypasses the ISP's ban on torrent sites, but also hides your IP address from the websites you visit.

**PROS:**
It's free
It is quite easy to configure
The browser is functional and intuitive (based on the Firefox platform).

**CONS:**
Speeds are usually painfully slow
You will get tired of solving captchas on conventional websites. Some websites (like news sites) block Tor entirely.
It doesn't anonymize your torrent downloads, only your internet browsing.

**Step 1**: download and install the Tor browser
You can download Tor Browser Bundle for Windows, Mac Linux, or Android from Torproject.org.

**Step 2**: navigate to your favorite torrent site
Using the Tor browser is very simple, and your traffic is automatically routed through the encrypted Tor network. All you need to do is enter the URL of your preferred torrent site in the browser bar (you may need to capture a captcha on some sites that treat Tor traffic as "suspicious").


**Method 3: Change the DNS server**
Often times, the only blocking implemented by ISPs is only at the DNS level. DNS, or Domain Name System, which translates IP addresses into website names, is widely used to restrict access to torrent sites. Because, by default, users use DNS servers that are regulated by ISPs. Therefore, making it a public DNS can solve the problem of difficult torrent site access.

The following public DNS servers are then used:

**Google DNS**: 8.8.8.8 | 8.8.4.4
**OpenDNS**: 208.67.222.222 | 208,67,220,220
**Comodo DNS**: 8.26.56.26 | 8.20.247.20
We can change the DNS server through the network settings and soon we will be able to access all the websites that are blocked by all the ISPs.

To change the DNS server:

In **Windows**: Enter the network device and right click> Click Properties> Ipv4 Properties. Then change the DNS server and click OK.

For **Mac OS**: go to System Preferences> Network> Advanced> DNS, add a new DNS server, and click OK.

On **Linux**: Click the Network applet> Edit Connections> Edit> Configuration for IPv> Automatic Addresses Only (DHCP)> DNS Server and add each new address separated by a comma.
